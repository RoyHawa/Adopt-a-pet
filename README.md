# Description
Adopt a pet is a Codecademy project for the React Router course.
The project was originally meant to be implemented using react-router-dom-v5, however, I decided to complete it using v6 and used the documentation for [upgrading from v5 to v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5).
